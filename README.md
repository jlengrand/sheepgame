# The Sheepgame

The Sheepgame was built as part of the **[4th Elm Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/elm-game-jam-4)**! 

In this game, use your keyboard to control the dog and send all the goats / sheeps to their pen! Kind of a tribute to [Babe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_(film))

## Tech

This game was built fully in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

To generate the playfield, we render an SVG frame and update it 60 times per second :).
We used the game jam to experiment with [Flocking behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)) and the [Entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
